# Import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

# Compute test set accuracy  
acc = accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)
print("Test set accuracy: {:.2f}".format(acc))




Using only two features, your tree was able to achieve an accuracy of 89%!
